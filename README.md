Sledge has countless features including modularity, mutability, and a modern codebase. It will soon have the ability to utilize plugins, which will enhance the editing experience and bring limitless oportunities to sledge's users.

### Modularity and Mutability

Sledge is fully data-driven. This means that all data in sledge can be changed by the user at any point. If you don't like the look of sledge, change the color scheme. If you don't think the font is good on your eyes, switch it to something different. Sledge is also fully built on plugins so if there is something that you think should be changed or added but it has not happened yet, you can download or create a plugin to do it.

### Multiplayer Framework
